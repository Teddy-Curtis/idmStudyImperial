This folder goes over getting the correct benchmark points, with the correct widths 
and branching ratios etc.
To make it easier to keep the files neat, this is separate to the MadGraph installation,
but it does use MadGraph to find the correct widths. 
This is done using the following steps:

1. First I create the param cards for each BP, this includes the correct masses for each point,
    the correct coupling constants.
2. Next I use the "compute_widths" function in madgraph to get the widths for the h3 particle. 
    Note that h3 = A0 = ~A0, for some reason the notation that madgraph uses here is ~A0. This
    then overwrites the param card for that BP, and updates only the width and the branching 
    ratios for the ~A0 particle.
3. This is then repeated for the h+ = H+ = ~H+ particle. Now all the param cards are set. 

Whilst all the parameter cards are set, it is also useful to get them in a different format:
    The "set ..." format. This is done for inputting into genproductions. 

Order of files to run:
1. Use setTemplateParameters.py file to do this
2 + 3. To do these steps use getWidths.py
